# Toolchain and Codebase Setup for The MbedOS + VS Code
Document how to set up a MbedOS toolchain to develop embedded firmware with Visual Studio Code. A lot of this information was taken from Mbed Official Website, 
then adjusted to fit Hukseflux needs.

This will allow you to develop firmware using either a NUCLEO development board, or a ST-Link programmer. For this description, the use of a STM32F446RE NUCLEO board is assumed. 
The intended audience for this page will know what to adjust to get another type of target device up-and-running.
